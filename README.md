### How find all the recipes:
- In REI search for `Nether Star` and `right click` or press `u`
  - It'll show the recipe for the Mega Bracelet
- Now you can press `r` on the Mega Bracelet to see the recipes for all the Mega Stones

### How Megas work:
- It functions just like in the original pokemon games, 
  - Only in battles 
  - Only one mon per battle
  - Mon has to be holding their respective Mega Stone 
- You have to have the Mega Bracelet in your off hand (can be changed in flourish's config, more info [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/flourish-cobblemon))
- While choosing an attack in battle, you have a new button that (once clicked) will mega evolve your pokemon starting on the next turn

## Known bugs:
Rayquaza not mega evolving (Flourish & ATM's implementation make this impossible, so if this ever integrates into ATM, easy needs to remove his rayquaza and megarayquaza, working on a easy to implement version/branch (v1.0b))
