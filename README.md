## Known bugs:

~~Altaria not mega evolving~~  
~~Medicham not mega evolving~~  
Rayquaza not mega evolving (Flourish & ATM's implementation make this impossible, so if this ever integrates into ATM, easy needs to remove his rayquaza and megarayquaza, working on a easy to implement version/branch (v1.0b))
